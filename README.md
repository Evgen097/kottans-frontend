 ##### Git course for beginners, very accessible and with examples.
   - commands for creating commits and tracking changes;
   - start using git is easy enough;
   - diff command to compare files.

  </details>
     
  ##### It was very interesting to pass the levels, it is much better to learn from examples
   - rebase command and how to use it
   - interactivity of the application, and how commits visually change
   - in further training, to visualize commits
  
-------------------
 ## 1. Linux CLI, and HTTP

#### 1. Linux Survival Guide (4 modules)

```
   When I watched development tutorials and saw how people use commands
   in the terminal, it seemed like magic to me.

   I liked the commands for changing directories,
   and I was surprised that you can send files to print from the terminal.
   Commands for viewing and filtering files I think will be very useful
```

2. HTTP: –ü—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª, —è–∫–∏–π –ø–æ–≤–∏–Ω–µ–Ω —Ä–æ–∑—É–º—ñ—Ç–∏ –∫–æ–∂–Ω–∏–π –≤–µ–±-—Ä–æ–∑—Ä–æ–±–Ω–∏–∫ - –ß–∞—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ 1

```     
         Interesting articles about the technical part of Internet protocols,
     about how computers communicate. It was useful to learn about several levels
     of caching and the use of proxy programs for debugging.
```
     
## Git Collaboration

 ```
         I think now I can use git for my projects and for learning. 
         Thanks to the course, I know how to make pull requests and collaborate 
     with other developers. I liked the lessons about Code Reviews
     and Continuous Integration, I think they are very useful
     to get acquainted with.
```

     
## Intro to HTML and CSS
-------------------

1. HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers

```
After a theoretical course on Coursera, you have the opportunity to immediately
try everything in practice.
It was interesting to learn about default styles, positioning of elements on 
the page and about colors. 
Most of all I liked the lesson about "box-sizing: border-box", I think it will be very useful in practice
```


## Responsive Web Design
-------------------
1. Responsive web design basics
```
Article "Responsive web design basics
"contain a lot of useful information that can be put into practice when creating sites.
It was interesting that you need to start development with an interface for a small screen.
```

2. FLEXBOX. –í—á–∏–º–æ—Å—è –≤–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞ —Ñ–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞—Ö
```
I liked the presentation of the material, everything is clear and to the point:
how to make up columns, footers and a few tricks for working with the editor
```

3. Flexbox Froggy - –≥—Ä–∞ –¥–ª—è –∑–∞–∫—Ä—ñ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—è

```
After viewing the theoretical material, the game provides an opportunity to
consolidate the knowledge gained and try everything in practice, made fun and interesting
```

4. CSS Grid Layout
```
Page layout on CSS Grid Layout looks a bit complicated, but at the same time
it gives a lot of opportunities to organize the code.
```

5. Grid Garden - –≥—Ä–∞ –¥–ª—è –∑–∞–∫—Ä—ñ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—è
   <details> <summary>Screenshots:</summary>

```
The game is made beautifully and interestingly, it gives you the opportunity 
to get acquainted with the grid system in practice, and try everything with your own hands.
